# shua's config files

this is a collection of my config files for various programs. these files are designed for swaywm and waybar on linux mint. these are my personal config files, so there is no guarantee that they will work on other systems.

this configuration is heavily inspired by the [constructed language](https://conlang.org) [toki pona](https://tokipona.org) and its logographic writing system, [sitelen pona](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/sitelen_pona).

i use linux mint and the colorscheme used here is [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).
